							<h1>Neuschwanstein Castle</h1>
							<h2>The Neuschwanstein Castle is one of the most visited castles in Germany <br> and one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe.<br></h2>

							<h3>The castle is located in Bavaria, near the town of Fussen.<br> It was built by King Ludwig II of Bavaria, also known as the “Fairytale King”.<br></h3>
							<h3>Seven weeks after the death of King Ludwig II in 1886, Neuschwanstein was opened to the public.<br> The shy king had built the castle in order to withdraw from public life – now vast numbers of people came to view his private refuge.<br>

							Today Neuschwanstein is one of the most popular of all the palaces and castles in Europe.<br> Every year 1.4 million people visit "the castle of the fairy-tale king".<br> In the summer around 6,000 visitors a day stream through rooms that were intended for a single inhabitant.<br>

							The setting of Neuschwanstein could not be more idyllic.<br> However, movement in the foundation area has to be continuously monitored, and the sheer rock walls must be repeatedly secured.<br> The harsh climate also has a detrimental effect on the limestone facades, which will have to be renovated section by section over the next few years.<br></h3>
